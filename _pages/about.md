# About Me
Welcome to my website. I am a Ph.D. candidate at Harvard Kennedy School (Politics and Institutions track).

My research centers on political methodologies and applications. Methodologically, I am interested in the intersection of causal inference and machine learning, especially causal inference methods for texts, images, and videos. Substantively, my focus lies on political communication and political violence.

I have contributed to several research projects aligned with these interests, and my work has been published in peer-reviewed journals, including *Journal of Conflict Resolution* and *the International Journal of Communication*.

Before joining Harvard, I earned an M.S. in Statistics from the University of Chicago and a B.A. in Political Science from Waseda University in Japan. Feel free to reach out to me at knakamura [at] g.harvard.edu.
